        <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Carlos Marques Lopes, and I'm 29 years old. I'm excited to share with you a small project I've built using Next.js. This is my first time learning Next.js, and I must say, it has been an amazing experience so far.

Next.js is a powerful framework that allows developers to build fast and scalable web applications with ease. It provides features like server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and hot module replacement, which greatly enhance the development process.

For this project, I decided to explore the capabilities of Next.js and create something meaningful. It's been a great learning journey, and I can't wait to showcase what I've accomplished using this fantastic framework.

I hope you enjoy exploring my Next.js project and witnessing the possibilities it offers. Feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions. Thank you for your attention!</p>
